# Bank Loan Analysis
# Problem Statement: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements

### Total Loan Applications
We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

### Total Funded Amount
Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyze the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.

### Total Amount Received
Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyze the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

### Average Interest Rate
Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.

### Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

### Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs

**Good Loan Metrics:**
- Good Loan Application Percentage
- Good Loan Applications
- Good Loan Funded Amount
- Good Loan Total Received Amount

**Bad Loan Metrics:**
- Bad Loan Percentage
- Bad Loan Applications
- Bad Loan Funded Amount
- Bad Loan Total Received Amount

### Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.â€™ By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.

### Charts and Visualizations

**Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):**  
To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.

**Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):**  
To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.

**Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):**  
To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.

**Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):**  
To assess how lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us evaluate the impact of employment history on loan applications.

# Steps to Implement KPIs and Visualizations

### 1. Define the Problem Statement
- Understand the key performance indicators (KPIs) required for analyzing loan data, including Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI).
- Identify metrics for Good and Bad Loans.

### 2. Write SQL Queries
- **Total Loan Applications:** Write a SQL query to compute the total number of loan applications, Month-to-Date (MTD) applications, and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
- **Total Funded Amount:** Create a SQL query to calculate the total funded amount, MTD funded amount, and analyze MoM changes.
- **Total Amount Received:** Develop a SQL query to track the total amount received, MTD amount received, and observe MoM changes.
- **Average Interest Rate:** Formulate a SQL query to compute the average interest rate, MTD average interest rate, and MoM variations.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Write a SQL query to evaluate the average DTI, MTD average DTI, and MoM fluctuations.
- **Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs:** Create SQL queries for metrics related to Good and Bad Loans, such as percentages, counts, funded amounts, and total received amounts.
- **Loan Status Grid View:** Develop a SQL query to provide a grid view report categorized by loan status, including metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Average Interest Rate.


### 3. Implement in Power BI
- **Data Import:** Import the SQL query results into Power BI.
- **Data Modeling:** Create relationships between tables if necessary, and define calculated columns or measures for KPIs.
- **Visualizations:** Develop the following charts:
  - **Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):** Visualize seasonality and long-term trends in loan applications and funding.
  - **Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):** Show regional disparities in lending activity and highlight regions with significant lending.
  - **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):** Display the distribution of loans across various term lengths to understand loan term preferences.
  - **Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):** Evaluate how lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different lengths of employment.
  - **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):** Provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans to identify common loan purposes.
  - **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):** Illustrate how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements, providing insights into borrower profiles.

### 4. Validate and Verify Data
- **Check Accuracy:** Ensure that the SQL queries return accurate results and that the data imported into Power BI matches expectations.
- **Cross-Verify with SQL Results:** Compare Power BI visualizations with raw SQL query results to verify correctness.
- **Adjust and Refine:** Make any necessary adjustments to queries or visualizations based on validation results.

### 5. Document the Findings
- **KPI Definitions:** Clearly document definitions and calculations for each KPI.
- **Visualization Descriptions:** Provide descriptions and insights for each chart and visualization.
- **Report Summary:** Summarize key findings and insights derived from the data and visualizations.

### 6. Share the Dashboard
- **Publish:** Publish the Power BI dashboard to the designated platform or workspace.
- **Access:** Ensure that stakeholders have access to the dashboard and understand how to interpret the visualizations.
- **Feedback:** Gather feedback from users to make any final adjustments and improve the dashboard based on their input.
